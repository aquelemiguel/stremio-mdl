An addon for adding MyDramaList lists as Stremio catalogs.

![screenshot](./public/screenshots/example.png)

## Installation

1. Open https://mydramalist.mano.sh.
2. Paste in the URL for the MDL list you want to add as a catalog (e.g., https://mydramalist.com/list/3EEVm9b3). Please note, the list **must be public** for the addon to scrape it.
3. Allow it to validate. It will check if the link is valid and the list is a "shows list" (as opposed to a "users list").
4. Install on desktop or web!

## About

I don't have access to MyDramaList's API, since it's in private beta (and frankly I didn't want to ask and wait either), so I just scraped their website.

Naturally, this approach is a bit brittle so if you're so inclined, if anything breaks please [open an issue](https://github.com/aquelemiguel/stremio-mdl/issues/new), contribute a fix or [email me](mailto:aquelemiguel@gmail.com). I work a full-time job but I'll try to be on top of it.

Now, a confession: I'm not really a K-drama guy. I originally did this for my mom for her to have easy access to her MDL watchlist on Stremio. So, I don't really use the addon myself... but I'm open to feature suggestions and contributions.

If you like what I do, consider [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/aquelemiguel) to support hosting costs. :)
